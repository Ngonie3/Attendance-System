Face attendance system which uses facial recognition to mark the presence of students within an educational establishment. The respective teachers are the only ones with login access to the system (admin priveleges), so as to avoid students falsely registering their presence. The system also records the number of times a student has been present, and also, the major of the student, student's full name, displays student's image upon verifying identity and the academic year the student is in.
